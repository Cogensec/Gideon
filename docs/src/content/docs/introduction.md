## The Gideon Philosophy

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Defensive Only**. Gideon is built *by* defenders, *for* defenders. It will never generate exploit code, malware, or provide instructions for offensive maneuvers.

Gideon follows a set of core principles:
1. **Transparency**: All reasoning is logged in a scratchpad for auditability.
2. **Corroboration**: Data is validated across multiple sources before being presented as fact.
3. **Safety First**: Every tool and command includes guardrails to prevent offensive use.
