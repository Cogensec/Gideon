title: Project Roadmap
description: Exploring the future of Gideon and its transition into an autonomous security platform.
---

Gideon is evolving from a security research assistant into a fully autonomous cybersecurity operations platform.

## Current Status (v1.0)
- ✅ Autonomous Task Planning & Self-Reflection
- ✅ Modular Skill System (NVD, VT, AbuseIPDB)
- ✅ NVIDIA Morpheus & NIM Integrations
- ✅ Defensive-Only Guardrails (NeMo)

## Future Vision

### Phase 5: Advanced Command System (Near Term)
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Gideon coordinating multiple "specialist" agents for complex incidents.
- **Dynamic Skill Loading**: Hot-swapping security connectors without restarting the agent.

### Phase 6: Enterprise Output System
- **STIX 2.1 Support**: Native generation of Structured Threat Information Expression.
- **Automated Root Cause Analysis**: Moving from evidence gathering to definitive cause identification.

### Phase 7: Real-world Simulation
- **Digital Twin Simulation**: Testing hardening policies in a sandboxed environment before deployment.
- **Advanced RAPIDS Analytics**: GPU-accelerated graph analysis of entire enterprise networks.

## Contributing to the Roadmap
